Embedded system has broad foreland of science and prospects of application. It becomes one of the most important inventions after personal computers and Internet. Embedded positioning system has great application prospects, which is the integration of GPS and embedded technology. According to the application prospects, this paper expatiates on the software and hardware design methods of positioning system based on LPC1768 and GPS. It uses GPS module to obtain location information, chooses GPRS wireless transmission function of GTM900C module to transmit information, adopts the LPC1768 as the controller to control the various modules orderly work. It uses TCP server establish connection between PC monitoring software and lower machine, and receives GPS positioning data, uses Google maps for display data. This paper achieved the software and hardware design of lower machine, design PC monitoring software, completed the task of design requirements.\r\n\r\nKey words: Positioning System, GPS, GPRS, LPC1768, Electronic map\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
